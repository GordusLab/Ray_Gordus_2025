Written by Amanda Ray (written 10.17.25)

The datasets are provided for the publication, “NeuroPAL: A Multicolor Atlas for Whole-Brain Neuronal Identification in C. elegans”, Yemini et al. 2021
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.12.012

Data obtained from: https://www.yeminilab.com/neuropal 

Code is written using Jupyter Notebook, python version 3.9.7


# Their dataset provides their own README file to understand their dataset structures. Please familiarize yourself with their README before using our modeling codes with their dataset. 

## Codes provided: ##

# Modeling with NeuroPAL Data.ipynb 
# This will basically walk through how we apply our models to the NeuroPAL dataset. Please make sure you use the other model codes first to familiarize yourself with the process. All the models are consolidated into this one code (not separated like with our dataset).

# NeuroPAL Correlation Rankings.ipynb
# This is how we found AIB presynaptic inputs that correlated highly with AIB activity, which is what we ended up using for modeling our sensory & RIM models.
